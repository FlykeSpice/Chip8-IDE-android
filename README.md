# Chip-8 IDE and emulator for android

A CHIP-8 IDE I created at the beginning of my Android development journey.

Originally, it was meant to be just the emulator part, but I felt that would be a too cliché of a goal, given how saturated the Android market already is with CHIP-8 emulators.

So, I decided to take a more original approach by turning it into a full-fledged IDE—one where you can not only play CHIP-8 games on your Android phone but also create them.
